# [NBA Player Positions]

### Paul Nguyen & David Herrero Quevedo

### Abstract
In this project, our group will describe the changes in playstyle types
throughout the NBA's history. We will perform PCA analysis to determine
the essential traits for different players, and then use important
principal components and unsupervised learning techinques to cluster
players into different "types" and see the movement in the proportions of
types over time.
